When couscous was made daily by hand, a bowl of semolina was mixed and tossed while water was gradually added and rubbed into the mixture. Traditionally handmade couscous is steamed in a pot called a couscoussier and takes three individual steamings to cook. This type of couscous is Moroccan couscous, named for where it originated. It is the tiniest form of couscous and is what most people think of as couscous. In the U.S., Moroccan-style couscous is manufactured, pre-steamed, dried and packaged in handy four-portion-sized boxes available everywhere. All we have to do is pour the right amount of boiling water over it, cover it, come back 5 minutes later and it’s ready to eat. Cooks who lived 300 years ago would be envious.",secondPart:"Couscous is a starch, and as such, is often the main portion of most meals in North African cultures where meat is scarce. Like rice, couscous is a blank canvas that can take on any flavors you want to add. Mixing it up and creating something new is what being inspired by cooking and ingredients is all about. The 5-minute cook time for couscous gives you extra minutes to concentrate on what amazing flavor combos you’ll be adding.",thirdPart:"Israeli couscous is made from the same semolina flour that Moroccan couscous is, but the balls of dough are larger and more consistently round. Israeli couscous is technically a pasta, so it’s cooked in excess amounts of salted water just like pasta and it takes eight to ten minutes to cook. Israeli couscous was invented in Israel in the 1950’s when grains were scarce and the government needed to feed the masses of immigrants arriving daily."}];return(K,s)=>(r(),t(n,null,[i(c),e("main",null,[s[1]||(s[1]=e("div",{class:"kosher-hero-wrapper"},[e("h1",null,"Our Kosher menu")],-1)),e("div",g,[s[0]||(s[0]=e("h1",{class:"kosher-menu-wrapper-title"}," Take a look at our delicious food ",-1)),(r(),t(n,null,p(d,o=>e("div",y,[e("img",{class:"kosher-menu-img",src:o.img,alt:""},null,8,w),e("div",k,[e("h2",null,a(o.title),1),e("div",_,[e("p",null,a(o.firstPart),1),e("p",null,a(o.secondPart),1),o.thirdPart?(r(),t("p",b,a(o.thirdPart),1)):l("",!0),o.fourthPart?(r(),t("p",v,a(o.fourthPart),1)):l("",!0)])])])),64))]),e("div",P,[e("div",x,[i(f(m),{as:"a",label:`Download our\r
